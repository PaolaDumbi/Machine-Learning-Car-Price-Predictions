# Machine-Learning-Car-Price-Predictions

In this project, two predictive models were developed for car prices using machine learning techniques. The initial
model utilized Linear Regression, while the subsequent model adopted the Lasso model. Leveraging a comprehensive
dataset, the objective was to enhance prediction accuracy. The implementation resulted in an improved R-squared
score, showcasing the models' effectiveness in forecasting car prices.
