# Machine-Learning-Car-Price-Predictions

Overview
This project aimed to develop predictive models for car prices using machine learning techniques. Two models were implemented: an initial model based on Linear Regression, and a subsequent model using the Lasso model. The objective was to enhance prediction accuracy for car prices.


Dataset
The project leveraged a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to cars, such as  selling price, year, fuel type, and other relevant attributes. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure its suitability for model training and evaluation.


Methodology
•	Data Preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned and processed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
•	Model Development: Two models were developed using scikit-learn: a Linear Regression model and a Lasso model. The models were trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict car prices.
•	Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics such as R-squared score to assess their performance in predicting car prices.


Results
The implementation of the Lasso model resulted in an improved R-squared score compared to the initial Linear Regression model. This improvement showcases the effectiveness of the models in forecasting car prices based on the dataset.


Conclusion
The project demonstrates the value of machine learning techniques in predicting car prices. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset and implementing advanced models, the project achieved improved prediction accuracy, highlighting the potential for practical applications in the automotive industry.
